The RichText widget allows you to display a paragraph of text with multiple styles.
TextSpan is used to apply different styles to different parts of the text.
The RichText widget in Flutter lets you display text with different styles all in one place. You can use TextSpan to style each part of the text separately.
Code file details:
The first part, "Hello," uses the default style with grey color and a font size of 30.
The second part, " World!!!," is larger, with a font size of 45, and itâ€™s in purple. The \n moves the next text to a new line.
Then comes "I am," which is also in the default style.
The next part, " Flutter," stands out with blue color, a large font size of 45, and is bold and italic.
Finally, "developer!" wraps it up with the same default style.
