The Positioned widget in Flutter is used within a Stack to position its child relative to the four sides of the stack.
This widget is useful when you want to place a widget at an exact position inside a Stack.
Stack: The parent widget that allows you to place widgets on top of each other.
Positioned: Used to position its child relative to the parent Stack.
top: Distance from the top of the Stack.
left: Distance from the left side of the Stack.
right: Distance from the right side of the Stack.
bottom: Distance from the bottom of the Stack.
In the example, the Positioned widget places its child at a specific location within the Stack. You can adjust the top, left, right, and bottom values to position the widget as needed.
