Flutter Range Slider Demo: Code Explanation
This Flutter application demonstrates the implementation of a RangeSlider, a widget that allows users to select a range of values on a sliding scale. 
The selected range is dynamically displayed as the user interacts with the slider.
The app is built using a stateful widget named RangeConcept, which manages the state and updates the UI in response to user input.

The RangeConcept class extends StatefulWidget, enabling the widget to maintain and update its state. The _RangeConceptState class defines the state,
where RangeValues is initialized with a start value of 1 and an end value of 100. This RangeValues object represents the selected range on the slider.

The build method in _RangeConceptState constructs the UI. The method begins by creating RangeLabels to display the start and end values of the slider. 
The UI is wrapped in a Scaffold widget, providing the basic structure of the screen, including an AppBar with the title "Range Slider Demo." 
The body of the scaffold is designed using a Column widget inside a Padding widget, ensuring the content is centered and padded appropriately.

The RangeSlider widget is the core of the demo, allowing users to select a range of values.
It is configured with properties such as values, labels, divisions, min, max, activeColor, and inactiveColor. 
The onChanged callback is critical, as it updates the values whenever the slider is moved, and calls setState to refresh the UI, displaying the new range.

Lastly, the selected range values are displayed using a Text widget below the slider.
The text is formatted to show the start and end values of the selected range, providing immediate feedback to the user.

This application offers a clear and interactive example of how Flutter's RangeSlider can be used to create a user-friendly interface for selecting a range of values.
The state management within the RangeConcept widget ensures that the UI is responsive and updates in real-time as the user interacts with the slider.
